### Step 1: traverse the matrix and find position of gold ###
    1) study graph traversal: leetcode 130, 200, 286 and Treasure Hunting
    2) Troll traverse the matrix and find treasure position
        (1) left up right down (travesable tile in list, search 1 round ignore visited, second round keep previous direction? ! use DFS, stepback stack)
        (2) Javascript save cell information as static objects : tuple as key? coords as name cell info as value
        (3) store gold position in gold.row, gold.col

### Step 2: build stacks and get treasure ###
    1) find 7 tiles connnecting to gold  
    2) sort all stack tiles on distance to 1st stair    
    3) move nearest blocks to build stairs
